# Konstruct-Core

Konstruct is an effort to empower the Game Developers to create robust operation pipeline
with minimal effort.

This package provides the core data types and async functions to build the Konstruct pipeline.

The design goals are:

- Cross-platform and async-friendly.
- Extensible and customizable (hacker-friendly).
- Make error handling part of the type system. Provide clear guideline on error handling and propagation.
- Good DX (developer experience).
- Keep thing simple and stupid.
